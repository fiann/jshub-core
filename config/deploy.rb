# load 'ext/rails-database-migrations.rb'
# load 'ext/rails-shared-directories.rb'

# There are also new utility libaries shipped with the core these 
# include the following, please see individual files for more
# documentation, or run `cap -vT` with the following lines commented
# out to see what they make available.

# load 'ext/spinner.rb'              # Designed for use with script/spin
# load 'ext/passenger-mod-rails.rb'  # Restart task for use with mod_rails
# load 'ext/web-disable-enable.rb'   # Gives you web:disable and web:enable

# Enable multistage deploys

# servers (which is the default), you can specify the actual location
# via the :deploy_to variable:

# your SCM below:
